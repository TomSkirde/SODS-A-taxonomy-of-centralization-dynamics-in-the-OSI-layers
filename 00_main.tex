Note: With \verb+\acrodefplural+ you can define custom plural. Refer to acronyms with \verb+\ac{}+ and \verb+\acp{}+. Sometimes you may need the capitalized versions: \verb+\Ac{}+. \verb+\Acp{}+ is sometimes buggy - if you need this and would like to include an index, consider using the ``glossaries'' package (I can help you out there).

\subsection*{for the use of plagiarism detection software to check my/our essay}

\textbf{What is plagiarism?} \\
Plagiarism is defined as submitting someone else’s work or ideas as your
own without a complete indication of the source. It is hereby irrelevant whether the work of
others is copied word by word without acknowledgment of the source, text structures (e.g., line of
argumentation or outline) are borrowed or texts are translated from a foreign language.

\textbf{Use of plagiarism detection software} \\
The supervisor may use plagiarism software to check each submitted essay for plagiarism. For that purpose, the thesis would be electronically forwarded to a software service provider, where the software checks for potential matches between the submitted work and work from other sources. For future comparisons with other essays,
your essay will be permanently stored in a database. Only the School of Business and Economics
of the University of Münster is allowed to access your stored essay. The student(s) agree(s) that his or
her (their) essay may be stored and reproduced only for the purpose of plagiarism assessment. The supervisor of the essay will be advised on the outcome of the plagiarism assessment.

\textbf{Sanctions} \\
Each case of plagiarism constitutes an attempt to deceive in terms of the examination regulations and will lead to the module being graded as ``failed''. This will be communicated to the examination office, where your case will be documented. In the event of a serious case of deception, the examinee can be generally excluded from any further examination. This can lead
to the expulsion of the student. Even after graduation from university, plagiarism can result in the withdrawal of the awarded academic degree.

I confirm that I have read and understood the information in this document. I agree with the procedure described for plagiarism assessment and potential sanctioning. \\[-0cm]
