\section{The Taxonomy of Centralization}
\label{sec:The_Taxonomy_of_Centralization}




Consistency in reference formatting is key. The following guidelines are \textbf{*not*} mandatory. But they will give you a feeling that uniformity in the references style has many facets that you should consider.


%############################4.1 
\subsection{Centralization at the physical layer (L1)}
\textbf{The only things I mandate are:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item To use an \emph{authoryear} citation style (as opposed to numeric), as it helps readers to quickly recognize papers previously encountered.
    \item To include a \texttt{DOI} or \texttt{URL} for every reference that is not a published book or there are good reasons why there is no online pointer for it
\end{itemize}
Both settings are already active in this template (provided the DOIs / URLs are specified in the references in literature.bib).
