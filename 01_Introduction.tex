To create a common basis for discussion, it is important to first define the terms \textit{digital identity} and \textit{subject}. A digital identity is often defined as a digital reference to a person~\citep{domingo2020SSI}. It is thus something that a subject has and uses in response to requests for digital identification, authentication, or proofs of authorisation. A digital identity consists of attributes that can be revoked, deleted, transferred, or exchanged, such as citizenship, institutional affiliations, and proofs of ownership~\citep{lyons2019blockchain,preukschat2021why}. Identity attributes are typically connected to a subject via a unique identifier within a system or domain, such as an index in a database or a social security number~\citep{bosworth2005entities}.
